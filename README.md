# dicebot
its a small project i realised with an attiny85 avr-microcontroller. it runs c-code which simulates a dive.

hi there, currently i started to code microcontrolers with c. im not a pro or anything close to it, just an electrical engineering stud. (1st year), who ist interested in automation and robotics. anyway, it was my first ever project i finished with some leds and resistors. i will upload the code, pictures and schematics, as soon as possible. its an easy project, and anyone who is interested in building a dicebot can use some of the ideas i had. if there are any mistakes in the code, schematics, etc. i made (iÂ´m a beginner with microcontrollers), please let me know, so i can learn from my mistakes. :)
